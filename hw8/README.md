Part 1
1. In the time allowed, how many images did you annotate? \
   All the 384 images
   
2. How many instances of the Millennium Falcon did you annotate? How many TIE Fighters? \
   Millennium Falcon instances:  298 \
   TIE Fighter instances:  268
   
3. Based on this experience, how would you handle the annotation of large image data set? \
   It is hard to accurately annotate data and can be error prone. It also needs lot of human resources. Synthetically producing data or using image augumentions may be better.

4. Think about image augmentation? How would augmentations such as flip, rotation, scale, cropping, and translation effect the annotations? \
   The box bounding the image will be different so it's bounding box dimension will change.

Part 2
1. Describe the following augmentations in your own words \
   Flip - upside down reflection of left to right reflection \
   Rotation - move in 360 degrees \
   Scale - make the image larger or smaller \
   Crop - cut part of the image \
   Translation - reposition the center \
   Noise - change pixel resolution(reduce)
   
Part 3
1. Image annotations require the coordinates of the objects and their classes; in your option, what is needed for an audio annotation? \
   Dimensions of the waveforms will be needed.
